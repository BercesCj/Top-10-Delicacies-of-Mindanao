<h3>Variations of Lambay</h3>
<p>While the basic version of Lambay remains the same, there are a few variations that make it unique to different areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Spicy Lambay:</b> Some versions of Lambay use extra chili or sambal (chili paste) to make the soup spicier. This version is perfect for those who love the heat and want to elevate the dish with extra layers of flavor.
<li><b>Coconut Lambay:</b> A variation of Lambay includes coconut milk, which adds a creamy texture and a mild sweetness to the soup. The coconut milk helps balance the saltiness of the fish sauce and the bitterness of the ampalaya.
<li><b>Lambay with Vegetables:</b> While the soup can be made with just the fish and basic seasonings, some regional versions include additional vegetables like squash, eggplant, or corn, making the soup more hearty and filling.
<li><b>Lambay with Rice:</b> Some versions of Lambay are served directly with pandan rice, which is scented with a subtle pandan fragrance. The rice complements the rich, savory broth of the soup, creating a complete meal.
