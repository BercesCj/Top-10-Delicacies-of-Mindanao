<h3>Variations of Coco Candy</h3>
<p>While the basic version of Coco Candy remains simple, there are a few variations and regional differences that add unique twists to the treat:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Coco Candy with Nuts:</b> Some versions of Coco Candy include chopped cashews, peanuts, or walnuts mixed in with the coconut and sugar mixture. The nuts add a crunchy texture and complement the sweetness of the candy.
<li><b>Coco Candy with Cocoa Powder:</b> In some regions, a small amount of cocoa powder is added to the coconut and sugar mixture, giving the candy a richer, chocolate-like flavor.
<li><b>Coco Candy with Coloring:</b> In certain places, food coloring is added to make the candy more visually appealing. Red or green coloring can be used, especially for festive occasions like Christmas or birthdays.
<li><b>Coco Candy with Pandan Flavor:</b> Some recipes include pandan extract or pandan leaves to add a fragrant, tropical twist to the candy, giving it a subtle hint of pandan flavor and a vibrant green color.
