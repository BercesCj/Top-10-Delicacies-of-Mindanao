<h3>Variations of Binu-atan</h3>
<p>Binu-atan may vary slightly from region to region, with local touches added to the dish depending on available ingredients and personal preferences. Here are some common variations:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Binu-atan with Latik:</b> Some variations of Binu-atan are topped with latik (coconut caramel), which is made by simmering coconut milk until the fat separates and turns into crispy golden bits. This addition adds a delightful crunch and extra flavor to the dish.
<li><b>Binu-atan with Fruits:</b> Some modern adaptations of Binu-atan include the addition of fruits such as mangoes or bananas for added sweetness and variety. These fruits complement the rich coconut flavors, giving the dish a tropical twist.
<li><b>Binu-atan with Jackfruit:</b> In some areas, jackfruit (langka) is added for additional flavor and texture. The fruit's sweet, floral taste pairs wonderfully with the creamy coconut and sticky rice.
