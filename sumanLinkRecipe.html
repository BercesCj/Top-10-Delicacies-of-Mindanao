<h3>Variations of Suman sa Lihiya</h3>
<p>While the basic version of Suman sa Lihiya remains fairly consistent, there are a few variations that make the dish even more special:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Suman sa Lihiya with Latik:</b> One of the most popular toppings for suman is latikâ€”a rich, caramelized coconut syrup made from coconut milk. This adds a delicious sweet and creamy element to the suman, making it even more indulgent.
<li><b>Suman sa Lihiya with Mango:</b> In some regions, suman is served with fresh mangoes, which provide a refreshing and tropical contrast to the rich, chewy rice cake.
<li><b>Sweetened Suman sa Lihiya:</b> While some recipes for Suman sa Lihiya are not overly sweet, others add more sugar to the rice mixture, making the suman a sweeter treat that can be enjoyed as a dessert.
<li><b>Suman sa Lihiya with Coconut Flakes:</b> Some versions of suman include shredded coconut mixed into the rice mixture, which adds a slight texture and coconut flavor directly to the rice cake.
