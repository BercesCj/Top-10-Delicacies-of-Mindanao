<h3>The Smoky and Spicy Flavor Profile</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Smoky:</b> The grilled chicken imparts a distinctive smoky flavor that sets the base of the dish. Grilling over an open flame or charcoal is an essential part of the process, as it infuses the chicken with that irresistible aroma.
<li><b>Spicy:</b> The heat from the chili provides a vibrant, zesty contrast to the creaminess of the coconut milk. The level of spice can be adjusted based on your preference, but traditionally, Piyanggang Manok has a moderate level of heat.
<li><b>Creamy:</b> The coconut milk and cream sauce gives the dish a rich, velvety texture, complementing the smoky and spicy flavors. The turmeric adds an earthy, aromatic quality, giving the dish depth and complexity.
