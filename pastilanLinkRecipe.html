<h3>Variations of Pastil</h3>
<p>While the basic components of Pastil remain the same, there are a few variations across Mindanao and beyond:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Pastil with Beef or Fish:</b> In some regions, beef or fish (like tuna) is used instead of chicken. The cooking method remains similar, but the protein changes the flavor and texture of the dish.
<li><b>Pastil with Sweet Soy Sauce:</b> Some variations include a drizzle of sweet soy sauce or a blend of soy sauce and palm sugar to add a touch of sweetness to balance the savory flavors.
<li><b>Spicy Pastil:</b> Some versions incorporate chili or sambal (spicy dip), adding a fiery kick to the dish for those who prefer spicier food.
<li><b>Pastil with Garnishes:</b> To elevate the flavor, some serve Pastil with additional garnishes like fried garlic, sliced hard-boiled eggs, or fresh herbs such as cilantro or green onions.
