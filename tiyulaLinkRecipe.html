<h3>Variations of Tiyula Itum</h3>
<p>While the basic components of Tiyula Itum remain the same, there are some regional variations or personal twists to the dish:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Tiyula Itum with Coconut Milk:</b> Some versions of Tiyula Itum include coconut milk in the broth, making the soup richer and creamier. The milk softens the intensity of the spices and adds a lush texture.
<li><b>Tiyula Itum with Spicy Additions:</b> Some variations of the dish are made spicier by adding more chili or sambal (spicy dip), which elevates the heat and brings extra depth to the flavors.
<li><b>Tiyula Itum with Fish:</b> In some coastal areas, fish (especially tuna) is used instead of goat or beef, adding a lighter, more delicate flavor to the soup while maintaining the essential black color from the charred coconut.
