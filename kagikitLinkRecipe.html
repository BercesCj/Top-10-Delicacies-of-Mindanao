<h3>Variations of Kagikit</h3>
<p>While the basic ingredients remain relatively consistent, Kagikit can have regional variations based on available resources and local tastes:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>With Cornstarch:</b> Some versions of Kagikit include cornstarch, which makes the texture smoother and firmer. This version is often easier to slice into neat portions.
<li><b>With Pandan or Vanilla Flavoring:</b> In some regions, a hint of pandan or vanilla is added to enhance the flavor and aroma of Kagikit.
<li><b>Kagikit with Rice Flour:</b> In areas where rice is abundant, rice flour is sometimes added to the mixture to provide a slightly more cake-like consistency.
