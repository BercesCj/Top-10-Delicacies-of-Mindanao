<h3>Variations of Satti</h3>
<p>While the core concept of Satti remains the same, there are some regional variations that add unique twists to the dish:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Spicy Satti:</b> Some versions use extra chili or serve the sauce on the side for those who prefer a spicier version. Sambal (a chili-based dip) may also be offered as a condiment.
<li><b>Satti with Rice:</b> In some places, the grilled skewers of meat are served alongside steamed rice or puso (rice wrapped in coconut leaves), making it a fuller meal.
<li><b>Satti with Other Meats:</b> While chicken is the most common meat, some variations include beef or pork, and even fish, which can be marinated and grilled similarly to the traditional versions.
